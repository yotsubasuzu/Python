        "## Lab Introduction\n",
        "Mycology is a branch of biology that generally deals with the study of fungi and mushrooms, and particularly their genetic and biochemical make-up, and their use to humans. Throughout history, fungi have been used for tinder, medicine, and food. For hundreds of years, specific mushrooms have been used as folk medicine in Russian, China, and Japan. Scientists elsewhere have also documented many medicinal uses of mushrooms as well, but not all mushrooms are beneficial--some are quite deadly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you're going to use decision trees to peruse The Mushroom Data Set, drawn from the Audobon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). The data set details mushrooms described in terms of many physical characteristics, such as cap size and stalk length, along with a classification of poisonous or edible.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a standard disclaimer, if you eat a random mushroom you find, you are doing so at your own risk. While every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained with the data set is correct, please understand that no one associated with this course accepts any responsibility or liability for errors, omissions or representations, expressed or implied, contained therein, or that might arise from you mistakenly identifying a mushroom. Exercise due caution and just take this lab as informational purposes only."
